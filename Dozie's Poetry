Continuum Robot Monologue: Sensors as Alchemy
Something massive is happening at the microscale. Micromanipulation of tissues promises pathways
to curing myriad bodily abnormalities. Yet the question persists: why is magnetic actuation
uniquely suited to this domain?
Magnetism stands as a fundamental force of nature, one that demands no external batteries or
power systems when permanent magnets are employed. An untethered, wireless microrobot paired
with an autonomous actuation source becomes essential when modeling systems with elegance.
Field planning reduces to a function of two Jacobian workspaces, dramatically simplifying the
computational burden.
This simplicity welcomes a richer complexity when electronics are embedded within the design of the untethered microrobot itself. Consider a wireless passive LC sensor that broadcasts its resonance frequency for signal processing, such a device introduces additional layers of modeling, fabrication, and characterization. The central question emerges: how does this research address the grander vision? In the grander vision, soft, carbon-based systems (the human body) merges with hard, silicon-based systems (elec-tronics). Learning to embed computerized functionality within soft systems resembles breathing life into the inanimate, a sort of modern alchemy.
Vector network analyzers and impedance analyzers sense LC circuit resonance, processing signals to extract meaningful parameters. Once extracted and calibrated, these parameters can be visualized in real time through straightforward programming. Imagine a magnetic continuum robot navigating the lungs: force or vibration data could guide its subsequent movements. The continuum robot and robotic manipulator would then become a magnetic autonomous navigation system through their sensing apparatus. Previously limited to reactive behavior, the robot can now process information and be proactive.
This alchemy of animating the inanimate has long captivated me. I now pursue this fascination through embedded sensors in magnetic polymers and magnetic navigation systems. Sensors embedded in polymers could revolutionize biosensing, pollution mitigation, and thermal management.
When inert rubbers are infused with magnetic nanoparticles, they acquire a primitive agency. When subsequently embedded with sensors, they gain a voice, the capacity to communicate their subjective experience of the environment. This is not panpsychism; this is engineering reality. Sensors are the alchemical key to material transmutation.
It is for this reason that the robotic revolution will prove far more transformative than our current AI revolution. There is no rational basis for performing tasks that another accessible entity executes more effectively. This raises a critical question: when should we cease mining our biological minds as resources and begin leveraging artificial minds instead? This question grows urgent as habits crystallize rapidly and underutilized faculties atrophy. Surgeons who rely on robotic methods without maintaining manual practice will eventually lose the ability to operate without technological assistance. Human thriving has brought about the transcendence of the need to even thrive in the first place, and it leaves us floating in a liminal space.

Chiaroscuro
By Dozie Ubosi

Horridas nostrae mentis purga tenebras, accende lumin sensibus!
(Purge the horrible darkness of our mind, light a light for our senses!)

A poem called ‘In the Shadow of You’

You shine like a star
Effortlessly so
In a life lived for love
We can’t say that everything goes
Unable to hide the discomfort
Of being sad and alone
Leave all wonder behind
And take a better approach

1. Greater things depend on lesser things, and these on

lesser things still
Walking into the abandoned monastery
I see a manuscript that seems awfully old

It belonged to an alchemist from the 18th century, he used to be a physicist
Academic aspirations turned into a life of hermeticism and chasing the occult, seems sad.

The manuscript details how he can bind human souls.

2. Geometrical Truth
The manuscript contains a lot of hypnotic mandala

I sink into a trance

The limitations of language becomes clear, I finally understand Wittgenstein
Ancient secrets become exposed to me through these images.

I begin to see images of a girl, a succubi

It’s a familiar face

3. Things are either concrete or abstract
I lived an entire lifetime while in the hypnotic trance
Living an entire lifetime with the succubi as my partner
We lived like hermits in nature cut off from society, in Clarens, Switzerland
Sounds of Gymnopedie No. 1 emanate from somewhere deep in my psyche

Falling deeper in love

My unconscious mind is at the forefront now

4. Pre established harmony
I awake from a hypnotic trance
Seeing real life with a new set of eyes
Images of another lifetime haunt my waking existence
I try to find the mandala so I can return to the dream life

But it is gone and Gymnopedie No. 1 is replaced with Schoenberg atonality and screeching

violins
I still feel the love

5. The origin of evil
I left the monastery
I live every second in fantasy

BUT there’s a difference between imagination and fantasy
Ancient symbols have been replaced with contemporary dionysian images
If I can experience a lifetime in my brain, that must be proof of the supernatural
My psychiatrist said there are two reasons people do drugs: Chasing pleasure or running

from pain.

6. The human mind can and should doubt everything except

that it thinks

I need to find a way to expose myself to the animal impulses of my unconscious

I had a dream I was a werewolf running through a field
I felt the region of my brain responsible for peace suddenly unlock
You glide through the air so much faster on all fours

It is ineffable

7. The present is pregnant with the future
The past, present and future exist simultaneously
Sometimes when I think of my life so far and all my experiences

They are all just an intangible memory
The triviality is so striking at times

8. In nature opposites seek one another
In nature opposites seek one another

Jung says “Although man and woman unite they nevertheless represent irreconcilable
opposites which when activated, degenerate into deadly hostility.”
I still believe being in love is the best elation attainable

Maybe when you love someone enough you can see past the irreconcilable opposites

In order to avoid the deadly hostility

9. Chiaroscuro

Apollo and Dionysus represent two sides of a coin
Just like Hermes and Aphrodite
The same as you and I

The visions from the manuscript haven’t left me

They’re just drowning with all my other experiences

Never Trust Anyone Who Listens to

Nocturnes in the Morning

The nocturnes were my morning and night and this turned me nocturnal.
Nocturnes are made to invoke the feeling of the night, thus listening to them in the morning
is unnatural but I did this anyway because the melodies were just so relaxing
I guess I’m obsessed with the feeling of nighttime
Fast forward a couple of months of listening to nocturnes non stop morning, afternoon and
night, I’m unable to sleep
I am nocturnal
Oftentimes it’s hard to see the consequences of your indulgences right off the bat but
everything sweet has a hidden bitter side
Now I only listen to nocturnes at night.

2

I Think It’s Because I Love You

It seems like I’m the one making the decisions but I’m just reacting to everything you do
I think it’s because I love you
“How can you love me when you don’t know anything about me?”
I don’t know, it can’t be explained. It’s quantum physics or something
Where are you? I’ll pick you up and explain everything!
“Nowhere near you, I’m sure about that”
Einstein’s not a genius, he’s a violinist

3

Tesla’s a Freak

An unhealthy obsession with completion is my problem
If I start something, I have to finish it
I think this has helped me escape the perils of nature
Nikola Tesla finished reading all of Voltaire though
Even I’m not that obsessed with completion
Who knew my obsession with completion would lead me to the greatest joy of my life
I will never be afraid to go too far again

4

Have You Heard of Voltaire
Taylor Swift is basically the Albert Einstein, Erwin Schrodinger, David Hilbert and Nikola
Tesla of our day!
“Wait, so Tesla and Taylor Swif...”
I can explain it to you, don’t worry!
Where are you? I’ll pick you up!
Nowhere near you I’m sure about that
A Physics Professor walks out of her office, holds a BAG of chocolates open in front of me
There’s different colours in there
I close my eyes and pick one
It’s a purple one
My first psychedelic

5

Trust me I can Explain it to You
I always swear I can prove the theorems I blabber
But it only makes sense in my head
Pythagorean theorem also seems easy to prove
But the proof isn’t so straight forward
Intuition always beats rigour
But rigour validates the idea
Trust me I can explain it to you

A Quote About the Devil Making
Surfaces By Wolfgang Pauli

On the first day of class I found out my teacher was a Python
He goes “I am a Bayesian”
He then goes “And now time for something completely new... as they say”
Then I realised, that’s a terrible attempt at a Monty Python joke
I waited after class to talk to him
It’s “now time for something completely different” not “completely new” I said
He was holding in his laugh so hard, I saw a vein on his forehead
I asked who’s your favourite member, he goes “Michael Palin”
Mine’s Eric Idle
Have you seen the Architect’s Sketch, I asked
“No” he said
And at that moment, I knew he was a freemason

7

All a Boy Wants is a Working Machine
I never had a working machine until last year
I had to take on a leadership role to build one
Being a leader is hard and uncomfortable
But it’s rewarding at the end
I finally built a working machine
It even had a fail safe

8

Professor Hypnosis

If you think of your brain as a signal processor
Schizophrenia is simply a glitch in the computer
“Sir I’ve been looking forward to this signal processing class since first year”
Basically I’m telling the Professor I’m a Skitzo
He said “Avoid Aliasing”

9

Dark Academia

I’m certainly a dead poet
Stomping on table tops
Captain my captain
I’m looking at a Kurt Schwitters painting
And I’m scared to death
I hate all this decadent art
That’s why they censored Baudelaire

10
Misogyny

If Picasso was a known misogynist
And Stravinsky’s rite of spring is about a virgin being sacrificed to the gods
Do I have to pay the price for the misogyny of the past
The trailblazers were misogynists
What separates my genius from theirs?

11

NOCTURNES

You’re the last person I think about before I fall asleep
I imagined our whole lives together
But here I am
A lifetime away from you
My hands are buried inside the soil
Inside of my soul
My love wears forbidden colours

12

Toronto Symphony Orchestra In the

Winter

I’ve never experienced something so beautiful
You’re the exception of course
Seeing all these stochastic events line up perfectly is nothing short of a miracle
I met the love of my life through random events that I somehow controlled
Slicing up time is a science
It’s an art like anything else

13
Solo Hikes

I had my first daydream about you in a trail
It all happened so randomly
One day in November, I decided to wake up to watch the sunrise
It was so cold
The thought of you kept me warm
Almost as though you were physically there

14

Handel’s Messiah or Mozart’s Requiem
You might go to Messiah?
Well I got you tickets for the Requiem if you change your mind
Count your dollars on the train
It’ll be a party
I can’t accept a penny for my thoughts
My thoughts are worth millions

15

Arrested for Chasing the Green Light
Left my house early this morning
Stopped at the Metro to buy some scones
I hiked all day
I guess because I didn’t sleep for days before, I was hallucinating
I offered a taxi driver scones to drive me to the airport
He said I needed cash
I found a building with a green light
Green is my favourite colour
I trespass into it
I sign into the building as Kento Masuda
The cops are called
I’m taken into their custody
But they don’t take me to the police station
They take me to the hospital
One of the cops calls me brilliant for some reason

16

How Do You Think Legends Are

Made?

I choose to maximise my youth
The fact that I believe in something
Doesn’t mean it exists
Why would I shift my focus to the supernatural
As though this life is not everything I have
There are joys and dangers associated with this way of thought
But my uncle told me there’s risk in everything
Even armed robbers take risks
I think I found my kung fu

17

We’re Minimalists Aren’t We

Watching reruns
Wearing old clothes
Little to no furniture
We’re minimalists aren’t we?

18

Can We Atleast Embrace Surrealism?

The pursuit of pleasure is paramount
Because pleasure feels good
And I like to feel good
Who the hell wouldn’t
Find something you love, and then push
Push as hard as you can
Push the door open and discover
Through discovery, you can create

19

Your Texts Have Me Stressing!

Let’s do a rendezvous pre rendezvous
I’ll pick you up in some sweater and button up drip
It doesn’t make sense on the surface
But it’s most abstract for me
Words can have a deeper meaning
I guess that’s why they censored Baudelaire

20

Frogs are Friendly Neutral

I saw a gross repulsive frog on my hike today
It made me think of you
It can’t be explained
It takes a genius to understand that it can’t be explained
It just has to be felt
I have to do it when and how I feel like doing it
Candles only burn for so long
And I do not choose when my fire dwindles

21

Trace the Sinusoids

If you trace the sinusoids
You will find no beginning
And you will find no end
You will only find a fragment of a gargantuan fractal
Patterns are not illusions
Determinism is law
But Stochasticity is the limit of perception

22

Nowhere Near You I’m Sure About

That

I listen to certain songs to feel the feeling of falling in love again
They are the closest I might ever get to the feeling
Songs like:
Erik Satie’s Gymnopedie #1
Sergei Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto #2 in C minor, Op 18: 2. Adagio sostenuto
Claude Debussy’s Claire de Lune
They all make me feel very close to the warmth love provides

Have you ever had a dream that felt like it made no sense? Well just because the meaning is out of your reach, doesn’t mean it has no meaning. In this paper I am going to prove that all dreams have a one-to-one linear relationship with reality but are represented in a more densely randomized topological space. The idea of using time evolution and infinitesimal generators to explain the connection between two spaces X and X1 , can indeed be generalized to provide a theoretical framework for understanding how dreams can have some basis.

Reality as a Hilbert Space: Let us treat reality as a structured space X. In this space, real
events and perceptions are represented as elements or states. These could include physical
experiences, memories, sensory inputs and cognitive processes.

Dreams as a Homeomorphic Space X1: Dreams can be thought of as residing in another
space X1 which is homeomorphic to reality. The idea is that dreams are not disconnected from
reality but rather transformations or projections of real experiences. There’s an underlying
connection between the two spaces where dreams are related to reality in some distorted or altered form.

Infinitesimal Generators as Cognitive Processes: Something called an infinitesimal
generator A generates the transformation between X and X1, cognitive processes, including
memory, imagination, and subconscious associations, generate the transformation from reality to
dreams. These processes might “evolve” over time or undergo continuous change, generating
dreams as modified reflections of reality.

Homeomorphism Between Dreams and Reality
In this model, dreams and reality are topologically similar, meaning that the structure of reality provides the foundation for the structure of dreams, even though dreams may distort or recombine elements of reality.
Continuity and Cognitive Evolution
The continuity of the transformation T(t) reflects that dreams are not random but systematically related to reality. Cognitive evolution and subconscious processes continuously map reality into dreams, following rules such as: emotional weighting, recombination of memories, and symbolic transformations.
Conclusion
Using the mathematical concept of infinitesimal generators and homeomorphisms, we can generalize the
idea that dreams have a basis in reality. Dreams are not random, disconnected phenomena, but rather:
• Transformations of real experiences through subconscious processes,
• Governed by infinitesimal changes in cognitive evolution, and
• Continuously linked to reality via a homeomorphic relationship

In this framework, dreams can be thought of as reflections or projections of reality, altered internal processes but fundamentally rooted in the structure of real experiences.
Thus, just as a homeomorphism preserves the structure between two spaces, dreams preserve a structural connection to reality, through a transformed and often denser and more symbolic topological form

I sit in my dark room as the cold from outside slowly fills it. Information and meaning
aren’t necessarily related. Often, the more information there is, the less meaning there
is. This leads to the thought of attention. Attention yields meaning but there can be little
to no attention if the amount of information is astronomical.
I want to explore the idea of mental states connected by context through relay networks.
If attention is the relay that turns information into meaning, then when people talk then
they are phase aligning through shared contexts. Let’s model how minds, interact
through a channel that preserves and filters energy at different recurrences. What
matters is not what they send, but how their coherences interfere in a shared field.

In a world saturated with data, meaning doesn’t arise from information alone but from
the scarce relay of attention. By framing mental states as spectral profiles filtered and
recombined through shared contexts, we see that individuals are not isolated minds but
oscillators in a larger field. When two or more profiles meet through a relay, the
interference pattern they produce cannot be decomposed into personal
contributions. The latent trace is irreducibly joint. This inseparability points towards
the world itself clustering us into energy domains that shape capacity for resonance.

Attention acts as the scarce switch that transforms streams of data into co-
herence, binding individuals into temporary fields of resonance. Earlier, we considered this dynamic in an example for two agents, where mental states are modeled as oscillatory signals filtered through a common channel, producing interference patterns that could not be reduced to isolated contributions The thing is, real interactions seldom occur in pairs. They unfold in groups, platforms,and systems where many signals collide, reinforce, or cancel across interactive systems. The mathematics of two-person coherence therefore generalizes into an
N-agent setting where collective fields arise from the superposition of multiple oscillators, each with their own spectral profile. In this extension, cross spectral matrices, coherence graphs, and latent inseparability reveal how interactive systems cluster participants into domains of resonance. The joint traces of these encounters are collective.

By extending the relay model from dyads to N agents, we reveal that coherence
is not a property of individuals alone but of fields that emerge when many
oscillators are coupled through a shared relay. The mathematics shows that
interference terms, cross-spectral densities, and latent projections are irreducibly
joint: they cannot be decomposed into isolated contributions. In practice, this
inseparability is what gives rise to collective surges, cancellations, and clusters
of resonance.
Interactive systems such as social platforms, collaborative technologies, and
human–AI collectives are not neutral carriers of information. They act as relays
that filter, amplify, and suppress frequencies, shaping the interference patterns
that determine which communities form, which meanings endure, and which
voices vanish into noise. Attention, the scarce resource that transforms infor-
mation into meaning, is redistributed and sculpted by these systems, making
them active participants in the clustering of human experience.
Seen this way, interactive systems are not just tools but fields of coherence.
Their design determines the stability of communities, the fairness of resonance,
and the balance between synchrony and fragmentation. To understand and
design them is to acknowledge that meaning, identity, and agency emerge not
from isolated signals but from the inseparable traces left in the shared field of
interaction.
Speculatively, such systems may become the most powerful shapers of collec-
tive life. They can collapse into echo chambers where interference locks groups
into rigid synchrony, or they can serve as relays that open entirely new domains
of resonance, enabling novel forms of thought and community. The direction
depends on how we tune the relays, and whether we design for amplification of
shared attention or for cultivation of diverse and constructive interference.

Living forever is an enticing promise, I mean who would not want to? It is why vampires
have the place they occupy in culture. One lifetime is hardly enough to experience
everything we want to and quite frankly, some need the promise that all their heart’s desires
will be granted if not in this life, then the next. Latching on to this promise is what keeps
many people in organized religion.
Wanting to live forever is simply the penultimate expression of greed albeit masked as
good. Like a wolf in sheep’s clothing. The reason is, most people can not imagine what that
other world would look like, it takes on the form of something resembling life on earth due
to the inability of the mind to picture anything beyond the state of affairs of Earth. It’s why
we can’t picture the fourth dimension and so on. The idea of eternal life is a concept in the
collective mind as an extension of life on Earth.
Being promised eternal life in exchange for your behavior on earth is not different from
Doctor Faust being promised worldly knowledge and power in exchange for serving
Mephistopheles forever. It is simply just inverted. For Faust, his reward is on earth and for
religious people, their reward is in ‘heaven’. Either way, your actions will be the currency. Is
this not starting to sound like a classic economic word problem that can be expressed in a
payoff matrix of game theory? In fact, this exists, and it is Pascal’s wager. The same
formulation of Pascal’s wager can be created for Doctor Faust. Now, the all-important
question is, should an entire existence be based on an economic game? While neither
Pascal’s wager or the Faustian bargain is a zero-sum game, one is still leveraging their
individual reason and strategical inclinations to get the reward which they most desire. And
most desires are driven by greed.
Now I want to explore religion as the reason for Sartre’s bad faith, Camus’ philosophical
suicide, and why most people are not Nietzsche’s Übermensch. To accept there’s no life
after death is a heavy decision. But I can comfortably say that this decision is the only one
that is not driven by some kind of greed. Maybe one may appear more secular/intellectual
by spouting atheism but on a deeper level, it is a selfless choice. Why else would anyone
endure all the existential darkness and uncertainty that comes with it? One is immediately
confronted by the overbearing Geist of nothingness. Nietzsche offers a solution to this,
whereas Sartre and Camus mostly just expand on the problem. Sartre’s bad faith and
Camus’ philosophical suicide are the problems and the Übermensch is the solution. If one
reads Thus Spoke Zarathustra and doesn’t have a crisis of faith, they have not understood
it.
The fact that Nietzsche went mad in his later years somewhat affirms my view that he was
indeed touched by some cosmic force.
‘After all, when the divine reaches down to touch the Earth, it is not a happy meeting of
opposites, a joyous union between matter and spirit. It is rape. A violent begetting. A
sudden invasion, a violence that must be later purified by sacrifice.’ – Benjamín Labatut
Nietzsche sacrificed his mind and purified readers with a clear view of themselves. I am not
here to echo Nietzsche’s profound meditations. My point is, becoming an Übermensch
does not involve strategic manipulations of rewards and punishments. It involves taking full
responsibility for the life you live on Earth and not putting the weight of your decisions
(good or bad) on other sources. It involves not being quick to judge certain things as evil but
human which is difficult.
The tightrope walker at the start of Thus Spoke Zarathustra symbolizes this problem
perfectly. The tightrope walker represents the existential tension between the Übermensch
and its animal nature. It encapsulates the inherent risk in striving to be an Übermensch,
with failure more likely than success. In the book, the tightrope walker falls and dies. No
false hope offered here. The tightrope walker signifies the striving human, doing what is
hard but necessary to evolve.
The path is not for the faint of heart. It means you have to forge your own purpose in life and
not accept ready made templates handed out by the dozen. But it is a selfless path and the
most life-affirming path one could take. It is the path that is not embedded with grains of
greedy sand.

1. First Meeting

Saw you with Shostakovich
It looked like you were telling him a dark secret
I wonder what you can tell me
I think it’s best we meet


2. Why don’t we all?

The first time I held your hand
It felt like I was a child being spun in a circle
You were the sage
Elucidating the border between joy and self destruction
Fire is the substance
Need it in over abundance




3. Rebellious Youth

It’s summer and I’ve been home
But I just landed a research job at Uni
So, I can see you twice a week
Leaning on the hood of the car
You feel like a breath of fresh air from an inhaler
You sound like Strawberry Fields Forever
Now let’s drive



4. Right off the Freeway

Park up, get out
Haven’t seen you in two days
Every time we hold hands
I feel like I’m with you when you’re gone
I started taking you out of your shell so you can be softer when it matters
I’m finding better ways to get the most out of you
I don’t even need to eat when I know I’m seeing you
I don’t feel hungry
You excite me chemically

5. Making me Creative

You are the substance
The sage showing me my mind
Can I ask why these ideas flood when I’m speeding on the freeway
Nah man I don’t party much as of late
I realize the party is in my head. Boring at times though
A party nevertheless
Shining with other clairvoyants is cool.

6. Passive Meditations

The Bhagavad Gita
The greatest book on detachment
Detachment is cool as long as I’m never detached from you my love.
That, I cannot accept
Twice a week is so little, it’s burdensome
I’ll see you briefly before the gym now
Fear for the body is harmful to the soul
One has to suffer and I choose my body.

7. In Private
It would be silly to broadcast our love to everyone
I like it when it’s just us
I can anthropomorphize you as much as I’d like
Cerebrotonia or Somatonia, either way, what’s the catch?
Once again, my logic may prevail
Is existence so precious that I cast away enjoyment of existence for the sake of just
existence?

8. But the Winter

How can we hold hands and move with the wind when the wind gets harsh and unbearable
You’re not an indoor person
Maybe if I listen to ‘Summer’s Over Interlude’ on repeat, this may work
Shit though, I already milked you for all the love you have through the Fall
Now winter has come suddenly
I can’t do this every year



9. April is the Cruelest Month

The weather gets better
The air gets hotter
My skin gets wetter
Of course I care for another
The earth is blooming again
The cycle starts again
Just like the first time

Bacchantes

The flow of unbridled passions
Lives in these doors
Pay for your ecstasy
Wasn’t fun in the moment
But reflection breeds the fondness
It’s not like you never tried
Look back and say “I tried”
Bloodlust and violent inclinations
Live in these doors
It’s a portal to the seemingly unending Bacchanal
The gods reach hysteria through laughter
As we swarm like particles to the unknown

Fissure
Beams of light turn into unbreakable symmetry
I’m stuck staring as I drive past these lights
Double aspect theory indicates that my soul is on these streets
My body though, is far removed
The lines are penetrating both my eyelids
I just can’t look away

Hunger

In a land of broken textures
I leave it behind to live
Wandering aimlessly in the barren streets
Cooking up an appetite for self destruction
“What’re you hungry for, mate?”
As he opens up a comically large trench coat
BLACK OUT
Woke up around noon, seeking transcendence in these old texts

Chasm of Fantasy

Death is in my pocket
And worms eat through the fabric
Stomping through the sludge in these black boots
Feeling elemental

Quantum Confinement

Sit there, so I can look into your eyes
This moment belongs to us
We were blasted from the electron gun
Now we sit here in a world of probabilities
So overwhelming
Our interference pattern cannot be decoupled

Vulgar Nocturne

The sun is setting with your blinds open
The end of your burning desperation
Another glass of water and conversations with yourself
Your motivation is peaking as the day dies
And soon the summer will be over
Another winter of harnessing potential
So what will we make of today?
All our dreams are in the land of tomorrow
And tomorrow never knows

Birds Don’t Dream of Stars
I always found it bleak that we are confined to the ground
There’s so much more above us
I think it’s supposed to be pronounced grave-ity
Because of the grave nature of it all

Mental Soup

These ideas are cooking everyday
In a viscous concoction
What a privilege!
To be on the receiving end of such violence
Disinformation and entertainment, just like butter and toast!

Nausea

Blood curdling longing
For a while, you’ve been falling
Head gets to throbbing
Just know one day
You’ll enter the land where you are belonging!

Clairvoyance
The upsetting dream haunts when night falls
The day always has its baggage
This is a military march towards fate’s cracked open door
Cue the John Philip Sousa
An aerial view of a city will make this clear
Another Faustian hominid, unfazed by lofty ambitions
Onwards and upwards! To the stars my friend!

Half-mad Sadistic Magician

In the basement of the Institute
Machines of loving grace oscillate
The fear of effort is simply the fear of knowing
In a tug of war with death
And hope is the rope
