Continuum Robot Monologue: Sensors as Alchemy

Something massive is happening at the microscale.
Micromanipulation of tissues promises pathways to curing myriad bodily abnormalities.
Yet the question persists: why is magnetic actuation uniquely suited to this domain?

Magnetism stands as a fundamental force of nature, one that demands no external batteries or power systems when permanent magnets are employed.
An untethered, wireless microrobot paired with an autonomous actuation source becomes essential when modeling systems with elegance.
Field planning reduces to a function of two Jacobian workspaces, dramatically simplifying the computational burden.

This simplicity welcomes a richer complexity when electronics are embedded within the design of the untethered microrobot itself.
Consider a wireless passive LC sensor that broadcasts its resonance frequency for signal processing.
Such a device introduces additional layers of modeling, fabrication, and characterization.

The central question emerges: how does this research address the grander vision?
In the grander vision, soft carbon-based systems merge with hard silicon-based systems.
Learning to embed computerized functionality within soft systems resembles breathing life into the inanimate — a sort of modern alchemy.

Vector network analyzers and impedance analyzers sense LC circuit resonance, processing signals to extract meaningful parameters.
Once extracted and calibrated, these parameters can be visualized in real time through straightforward programming.
Imagine a magnetic continuum robot navigating the lungs: force or vibration data could guide its subsequent movements.
The continuum robot and robotic manipulator would then become a magnetic autonomous navigation system through their sensing apparatus.
Previously limited to reactive behavior, the robot can now process information and be proactive.

This alchemy of animating the inanimate has long captivated me.
I now pursue this fascination through embedded sensors in magnetic polymers and magnetic navigation systems.
Sensors embedded in polymers could revolutionize biosensing, pollution mitigation, and thermal management.

When inert rubbers are infused with magnetic nanoparticles, they acquire a primitive agency.
When subsequently embedded with sensors, they gain a voice — the capacity to communicate their subjective experience of the environment.
This is not panpsychism; this is engineering reality.
Sensors are the alchemical key to material transmutation.

It is for this reason that the robotic revolution will prove far more transformative than our current AI revolution.
There is no rational basis for performing tasks that another accessible entity executes more effectively.
This raises a critical question: when should we cease mining our biological minds as resources and begin leveraging artificial minds instead?
This question grows urgent as habits crystallize rapidly and underutilized faculties atrophy.
Surgeons who rely on robotic methods without maintaining manual practice will eventually lose the ability to operate without technological assistance.
Human thriving has brought about the transcendence of the need to even thrive in the first place, and it leaves us floating in a liminal space.

Chiaroscuro
By Dozie Ubosi

Horridas nostrae mentis purga tenebras, accende lumin sensibus!
(Purge the horrible darkness of our mind, light a light for our senses!)

A poem called “In the Shadow of You”

You shine like a star
Effortlessly so
In a life lived for love
We can’t say that everything goes
Unable to hide the discomfort
Of being sad and alone
Leave all wonder behind
And take a better approach

Greater things depend on lesser things, and these on lesser things still.
Walking into the abandoned monastery, I see a manuscript that seems awfully old.
It belonged to an alchemist who used to be a physicist.
Academic aspirations turned into a life of hermeticism and chasing the occult.
The manuscript details how he can bind human souls.

Geometrical truth lies in the mandala.
I sink into a trance.
The limitations of language become clear — I finally understand Wittgenstein.
Ancient secrets become exposed to me through these images.
I begin to see images of a girl, a succubi.
It’s a familiar face.

Things are either concrete or abstract.
I lived an entire lifetime in the hypnotic trance.
With the succubi as my partner, we lived like hermits in Clarens, Switzerland.
The sounds of Gymnopedie echo through my mind as I fall deeper in love.
My unconscious mind is now at the forefront.

I awake from the trance seeing real life with new eyes.
Images of another lifetime haunt me.
I try to find the mandala to return, but it is gone.
Gymnopedie is replaced with Schoenberg’s atonality and screeching violins.
I still feel the love.

I left the monastery.
I live every second in fantasy.
There’s a difference between imagination and fantasy.
Ancient symbols have become contemporary Dionysian images.
If I can live a lifetime in my brain, it must be proof of the supernatural.
My psychiatrist said there are two reasons people do drugs: chasing pleasure or running from pain.

I need to find a way to expose myself to the animal impulses of my unconscious.
I dream I am a werewolf running through a field.
I feel the region of my brain responsible for peace suddenly unlock.
You glide faster on all fours.
It is ineffable.

The past, present, and future exist simultaneously.
Sometimes when I think of my life, it feels like intangible memory.
The triviality is striking.

In nature opposites seek one another.
Jung says although man and woman unite, they remain irreconcilable opposites.
I still believe being in love is the best elation attainable.
Maybe when you love enough, you can see past the hostility.

Apollo and Dionysus represent two sides of a coin, like Hermes and Aphrodite — like you and I.
The visions haven’t left me. They are just drowning among my other experiences.

Never Trust Anyone Who Listens to Nocturnes in the Morning
By Dozie Ubosi

The nocturnes were my morning and night and this turned me nocturnal.
They are meant for the night, so listening in the morning is unnatural — but I did anyway.
The melodies were relaxing. I was obsessed with nighttime.
After months, I couldn’t sleep.
Everything sweet has its hidden bitter side.
Now I only listen to nocturnes at night.

I Think It’s Because I Love You

It seems like I am the one making the decisions
But I am reacting to everything you do
I think it is because I love you

How can you love me when you do not know anything about me
I do not know
It cannot be explained
It is quantum physics or something

Where are you
I will pick you up and explain everything
Nowhere near you
I am sure about that

Einstein is not a genius
He is a violinist

Tesla’s a Freak

An unhealthy obsession with completion is my problem
If I start something
I have to finish it
It helped me escape the perils of nature

Nikola Tesla finished reading all of Voltaire
Even I am not that obsessed
My obsession with completion led me to the greatest joy of my life
I will never be afraid to go too far again

Have You Heard of Voltaire

Taylor Swift is the Einstein the Schrodinger the Hilbert and the Tesla of our day
Wait so Tesla and Taylor Swif
I can explain it to you
Do not worry

Where are you
I will pick you up
Nowhere near you
I am sure about that

A physics professor walks out of her office
Holds a bag of chocolates open in front of me
There are different colours in there
I close my eyes and pick one
It is purple
My first psychedelic

Trust Me I Can Explain It To You

I always swear I can prove the theorems I blabber
But it only makes sense in my head

Pythagorean theorem seems easy to prove
But the proof is not so straightforward

Intuition beats rigour
Rigour validates the idea

Trust me
I can explain it to you

A Quote About the Devil Making Surfaces

On the first day of class I learned my teacher was a python
He said I am a Bayesian
And now time for something completely new as they say

That is a terrible attempt at a Monty Python joke
It is now time for something completely different

He held in his laugh
I asked who is your favourite member
He said Michael Palin
Mine is Eric Idle

Have you seen the architect sketch
No
At that moment I knew he was a freemason

All a Boy Wants Is a Working Machine

I never had a working machine until last year
I took a leadership role to build one
Being a leader is hard and uncomfortable
It is rewarding in the end
I built a working machine
It even had a fail safe

Professor Hypnosis

If you think of your brain as a signal processor
Schizophrenia is a glitch in the computer

Sir I have looked forward to this signal processing class since first year
I am basically telling the professor I am a skitzo
He said avoid aliasing

Dark Academia

I am a dead poet
Stomping on table tops
Captain my captain

I look at a Kurt Schwitters painting
I am scared to death
I hate decadent art
That is why they censored Baudelaire

Misogyny

If Picasso was a known misogynist
And Stravinsky wrote a rite about a virgin sacrificed to the gods
Do I pay the price for the misogyny of the past

The trailblazers were misogynists
What separates my genius from theirs

Nocturnes

You are the last person I think about before I sleep
I imagined our whole lives together
But here I am
A lifetime away from you

My hands are buried in the soil
Inside my soul
My love wears forbidden colours

Toronto Symphony Orchestra in the Winter

I have rarely seen something so beautiful
You are the exception of course

Stochastic events lined up like a miracle
I met the love of my life through random paths I somehow controlled

Slicing time is a science
It is an art like anything else

Solo Hikes

I had my first daydream about you on a trail
It happened randomly
One cold morning in November I woke to catch the sunrise
The thought of you kept me warm
As though you were there

Handel’s Messiah or Mozart’s Requiem

You might go to Messiah
I got you tickets for the Requiem if you change your mind

Count your dollars on the train
It will be a party
I cannot accept a penny for my thoughts
My thoughts are worth millions

Arrested for Chasing the Green Light

I left my house early
Stopped for scones
Hiked all day
Sleep deprived
Hallucinating

I offered a taxi driver scones for a ride to the airport
He asked for cash

I found a building with a green light
Green is my favourite colour
I trespassed
Signed in under a new name
The cops came

They took me to a hospital
One of them called me brilliant

How Do You Think Legends Are Made

I choose to maximize my youth
Belief does not make things exist

Why shift focus to the supernatural
As though this life is not everything I have

Joys and dangers follow this way of thought
There is risk in everything
Even thieves take risks
I think I found my kung fu

We’re Minimalists Aren’t We

Watching reruns
Wearing old clothes
Little furniture
We are minimalists
Aren’t we

Can We At Least Embrace Surrealism

The pursuit of pleasure is paramount
Because pleasure feels good
Find something you love and push
Push the door open and discover
Through discovery you create

Your Texts Have Me Stressing

Let us do a rendezvous before the rendezvous
I will pick you up in sweater and button up drip
It makes little sense on the surface
It is abstract for me

Words can carry deeper meaning
That is why they censored Baudelaire

Frogs Are Friendly Neutral

I saw a repulsive frog on my hike
It made me think of you
It cannot be explained

It takes a genius to understand that it cannot be explained
It must be felt

I have to do it when and how I feel it
Candles burn for only so long
I do not choose when my fire dwindles

Trace the Sinusoids

Trace the sinusoids
You will find no beginning
You will find no end

You will find a fragment of a vast fractal
Patterns are not illusions
Determinism is law
Stochasticity is the limit of perception

Nowhere Near You I’m Sure About That

I listen to certain songs to feel the feeling of falling in love again
They are the closest I may get to the warmth of love

Songs like
Erik Satie Gymnopedie
Sergei Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto in minor Adagio sostenuto
Claude Debussy Clair de Lune
They bring me near to that warmth

Dreams and Reality as Spaces

Have you had a dream that felt senseless
Meaning out of reach does not mean no meaning

I propose that dreams have a one to one linear relation with reality
Represented in a denser randomized topological space

Reality as a Hilbert Space
Treat reality as a structured space
Events and perceptions as states
Physical experiences memories sensory inputs cognitive processes

Dreams as a Homeomorphic Space
Dreams reside in a space homeomorphic to reality
They are transformations of real experiences
Distorted projections with an underlying connection

Infinitesimal Generators as Cognitive Processes
An infinitesimal generator produces transformations between spaces
Memory imagination and subconscious association evolve states from reality to dreams
Dreams are modified reflections of reality

Homeomorphism and Continuity
Dreams and reality are topologically similar
Continuity of the transformation implies systematic relation
Emotional weighting recombination of memories symbolic transformations

Conclusion
Dreams are transformations of real experience through subconscious processes
Governed by infinitesimal changes in cognitive evolution
Linked to reality through a homeomorphic relation
They preserve structure while altering form into denser symbolic topology

Attention and Relay Networks

I sit in my dark room as the cold creeps in
Information and meaning are not the same
More information can yield less meaning

Attention yields meaning
But attention collapses when information is astronomical

I explore mental states connected by context through relay networks
When people speak
They phase align through shared contexts
Model minds as signals through a channel that preserves and filters recurrences
Meaning arises from how coherences interfere in a shared field

In a saturated world
Meaning emerges from the scarce relay of attention
Minds are oscillators in a larger field
When profiles meet through a relay
Their interference cannot be decomposed into personal parts
The latent trace is joint and inseparable
The world clusters us into resonance domains

Extend from pairs to many agents
Collective fields arise from superposed oscillators
Cross spectral matrices coherence graphs and latent inseparability reveal clustering
Joint traces are collective

Coherence is a property of fields not individuals
Interference terms and cross spectral densities are irreducibly joint
Interactive systems are relays that filter amplify and suppress
They shape patterns that decide which communities form and which voices fade

Attention is redistributed by these systems
They become fields of coherence
Design determines stability fairness and balance between synchrony and fragmentation
Echo chambers lock groups into rigid synchrony
Better relays open new domains of resonance
The direction depends on how we tune the relays

On Vampires Religion and the Will to Live Forever

Living forever is an enticing promise
Vampires hold their place in culture because one lifetime feels small

Eternal life often mirrors earthly life
The mind cannot picture beyond the known
The idea persists as an extension of earth

The Faustian bargain and wagers of faith frame existence as a payoff game
Should an existence be based on an economic game
Desire often hides as greed

Religion can enable bad faith and philosophical escape
Accepting no life after death is a heavy selfless choice
It faces the spirit of nothingness directly

Nietzsche offers a path where others outline the problem
The overman is responsibility without borrowed authority
Not manipulation of rewards and punishments
The tightrope walker shows the risk
Failure is likely
Yet striving is necessary

Forge your purpose
Refuse templates
It is a hard path
It is selfless
It affirms life

First Meeting

I saw you with Shostakovich
You told him a dark secret
What can you tell me
It is best we meet

Why Don’t We All

The first time I held your hand
I felt like a child spun in a circle
You were the sage
Marking the border between joy and self destruction
Fire is the substance
I want it in abundance

Rebellious Youth

It is summer and I am home
I landed a research job at the university
I can see you twice a week

Leaning on the hood of the car
You feel like a breath from an inhaler
You sound like strawberry fields forever
Let us drive

Right Off the Freeway

Park and step out
I have not seen you in days

When we hold hands I am with you when you are gone
I coax you out of your shell so you are softer when it matters
I find better ways to get the most out of you

I do not need to eat when I know I will see you
I am not hungry
You excite me chemically

Making Me Creative

You are the substance
The sage who shows me my mind

Why do ideas flood when I am speeding
I do not party much now
The party is in my head
Boring sometimes
A party nevertheless
Shining with other clairvoyants is cool

Passive Meditations

The Bhagavad Gita is the greatest book on detachment
Detachment is cool so long as I am not detached from you my love
That I cannot accept

Twice a week is little
It is burdensome
I will see you briefly before the gym

Fear for the body harms the soul
One must suffer
I choose my body

Quiet Vows

It is silly to broadcast our love
I like it when it is just us

I can anthropomorphize you as I like
Cerebrotonia or somatonia
What is the catch

Is existence so precious that I cast away enjoyment for the sake of existence alone

Against the Wind

How do we hold hands and move with the wind when the wind grows harsh
You are not an indoor person

Maybe if I loop a summer interlude it will work
But I already milked your love through the fall
Winter came suddenly
I cannot do this every year

April Is the Cruelest Month

The weather warms
The air thickens
My skin glistens
Of course I care for another

The earth blooms again
The cycle restarts
Just like the first time

Bacchanal Doors

The flow of unbridled passions lives in these doors
Pay for your ecstasy
It was not fun in the moment
Reflection breeds fondness

It is not like you never tried
Look back and say I tried

Bloodlust and violent leanings live here
A portal to the bacchanal without end
The gods reach hysteria through laughter
We swarm like particles toward the unknown

Light Beams and Symmetry

Beams harden into symmetry
I stare as I drive past lights
Double aspect theory says my soul is on these streets
My body is far removed
Lines penetrate both eyelids
I cannot look away

Broken Textures

In a land of broken textures I leave to live
Wandering the barren streets
Cooking an appetite for self destruction

What are you hungry for mate
He opens a comically large coat
Black out

I wake near noon
Seeking transcendence in old texts

Chasm of Fantasy

Death is in my pocket
Worms eat through the fabric
Boots stomp the sludge
I feel elemental

Quantum Confinement

Sit there so I can look into your eyes
This moment is ours

We were blasted from the electron gun
Now we sit in a world of probabilities
Overwhelming

Our interference cannot be decoupled

Vulgar Nocturne

The sun sets with your blinds open
The end of burning desperation

Another glass of water
Conversations with yourself

Motivation peaks as the day dies
Summer will end
Another winter to harness potential

What will we make of today
Dreams live in the land of tomorrow
And tomorrow never knows

Birds Don’t Dream of Stars

It is bleak to be confined to the ground
There is more above us

I think it should be pronounced grave ity
Because of the grave nature of it all

Mental Soup

Ideas cook each day
In a viscous concoction

What a privilege
To receive such violence

Disinformation and entertainment
Butter and toast

Nausea

A blood curdling longing
Falling for a while
Head throbbing

One day you will enter the land where you belong

Clairvoyance

The upsetting dream stalks the night
The day carries its baggage

This is a march toward the cracked door of fate
Cue the marching band

An aerial view of the city clarifies it
Another Faustian hominid unfazed by ambition
Onward and upward to the stars

Half-Mad Sadistic Magician

In the basement of the institute
Machines of loving grace oscillate

The fear of effort is the fear of knowing
A tug of war with death
Hope is the rope

Markov Chains Time and The Robotic State

Mathematicians assume Markov chains remain hidden
Consider Hilbert spaces and relativity abstractly
Reconsider the infinitesimally close situation of a robot’s motion
The seconds that doctor human time may not suit the robot model

Step into the robotic state
It is a world of mathematics and philosophy

Markov models predict the future using present and past values
If the past repeats and remains pertinent
The robot stagnates
Flux between states that do not move it toward or away from its goal

Lead a horse to water
It may not drink
The horse must like you

To dissect this agenda we meet at the intersection of probability and differential equations
We test the Gaussian and its limits

Glossary
Markov process — a stochastic process deciding a sequence of events
Gaussian distribution — a continuous probability distribution
Stochasticity — randomness as nature
Determinism — events by fate
Bayesianism — events by probability

With stochasticity at the core of hidden models and determinism a strong view
We must choose whether to starve or flood neural networks with data
Accept waiting as a side effect
Keep morale with mid scale performance
Or gamble and risk burnout chasing uncertain scaling

The Gaussian assumes symmetry around a mean
When assumptions shift
Frequency and intensity warp
Processing time delays or does not
Cause and effect bend across perspectives

Non standard distributions remind us
The model and the world are not always in sync

The debate is not binary
It reflects temperament and worldview
As a wise voice said
I am a Bayesian until further notice
